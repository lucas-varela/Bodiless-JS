To delete a page:

01. From the page you wish to delete, open the _Page_ menu, and click the **Delete** button.
01. You will be asked if you are sure you want to delete the current page.  
    ![Delete Page - Are you sure you want to delete the current page?](./assets/PageDeletePage.jpg
    ':size=65%')
    * Click the checkmark to confirm.
    * Click the "X" icon to cancel.

      to the deleted page's parent page.

    * If unsuccessful, an error message will display, informing you of the issue.  
      For more information, see the [Error Messages](#error-messages) section below.

?> **Technical Note:** Using the **Delete** operation will delete the page and its associated JSON
data. Image media and other items, however, will _not_ be deleted (i.e., they will continue to
persist in the system). This persistence is especially relevant when these items are being used on
other pages.
